# Covid-19 Data Scrapping 
# Project Name: Covid-19 Data Scrapping Analysis


----
# Project Overview: The aim of this project was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on global mortality rates by analyzing the relationship between confirmed cases and deaths across different countries.


----
# Data Collection: COVID-19 data from June 2020 to March 2022 was scraped from GitHub, including information on daily confirmed cases and deaths in multiple countries.


----
# Data Cleaning and Preparation:
# The data was imported into Microsoft Excel power query through the web, death, confirmed, and recovery cases datasets were merged.
# Any inconsistencies or missing values were removed.
# Additionally, the total death rates were calculated by the total sum of deaths.


----
# Analysis Techniques:
# Pivot tables were utilized to summarize the data by country and month, providing an overview of the total confirmed cases, total deaths, and death rates.
# Line graphs were created to visually represent the trends in confirmed cases and deaths over time.


----
# Results and Findings:
# The analysis revealed varying mortality rates among countries, with some countries experiencing higher death rates than others.
# United States has the highest prevalence (confirmed cases) of Covid19 infection.
# North Korea has the lowest prevalence (confirmed cases) of Covid19 with just 300 reported cases.
# India has the highest prevalence of recovered cases of Covid19 and the United States has the highest number of recorded death cases.
# The line graphs demonstrated an initial surge in confirmed cases.
